Potential Flow:

- Scrape all rosters and starting lineups from NFL Fantasy			** mostly done
- Backend API endpoint to get player's stats for a given week:
	- checks local DB first for stats/player info
	- If local entry does not exist:
		- scrape Pro Football Reference
		- save to local DB for future use
